# PixabayApi
In this code you will able to find the how to get image data using PixabayApi.
we are getting the images data as per the user requirement, Your will able to give his/her credentials according to their use.
And we are the user for their name, once he filled his name, we are checking with our data whether user is exist or not.
User name will be stored in data.txt file.
If user doesn't exist we are creating the 'New User Folder' with his/her name.
If user already exists then we are adding their data to his/her existing dir.
**I am saving the user data using 'shutil' package**

I will try to update this with **How to collect video files using this api.**
