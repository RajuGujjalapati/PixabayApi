# PixabayApi
Here i am going to explain why and what is the use of this api.

I have applied for an job, they asked me to do a deep learning model to qualify first round.
Unfortunality, being a new model i have to collect a 100's of images of different species.
I explored this api (unfortunatly) for my web developement project, and used the same to download the differnet species.

How the code works?
Whenever we'r running the prgm, type the name of the images you want to download.
The code automatically downloads 10 pages of images by creating seperate folders of each page with all images on that page with time.


**I am saving the user data using 'shutil' package**

I will try to update this with **How to collect video files using this api.**
